# Improvyze

Shuffle through quotations, record and share your speeches, and perfect your timing with Improvyze's UNIQUE competition and cue display features! 


Improvyze is a practice app for anyone learning impromptu speaking. This app is perfect for those who want to practice for class or for high school and college forensics competitions. Whether you're new to impromptu speaking or a seasoned veteran, Improvyze has something to offer for you, including two UNIQUE FEATURES found nowhere else:

++++

Cue displays: Practice your speech with a two point or three point format display! During your speech, Improvyze provides visual cues, telling you exactly when one part of your speech should end and when the next begins (e.g. introduction to first main point, first main point to second main point, etc.) This feature is meant to help impromptu speakers perfect the timing of their speeches!

Competition mode: Practice as if you're competing in an actual impromptu round! The display is minimal and provides visual cues, telling you when important times have passed-- just like a competition judge!
